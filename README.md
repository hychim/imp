# Assembling protein complex with IMP
This project aims to model large protein complex from combination of protein subunits using IMP.

## Requirement
1. BioPython
2. IMP
3. sys

## Procedure
1. Put all your dimer in to data folder and convert them into cross linking data using pdb2crosslink.py

### pdb2cl
Covert predicted structure from AF to cross link data form.
