# Assembling protein complex with IMP
This project aims to model large protein complex from combination of protein subunits using IMP.

# Computational Requirement
The only requirement is to clone this github repository and set up a conda environment before running the script.
```bash
clone https://github.com/hychim/imp.git
conda create --prefix $YOUR_PATH -f environment.yml
```

## Procedure
